Implementation of various algorithms in Go

There is no better way to really understand how something works
and can be implemented with a particular technology, than doing it.

- Binary search
- Dijkstra algorithm (shortest path)
- Breadth first search (smallest number of segments)
- Quicksort (divide-and-conquer approach)
